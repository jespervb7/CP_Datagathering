[Script Name]: tournify_scrapper

[Description]
This script scrapes data from the tournify website. It's made to be for the Canoe Polo tournaments, but I suppose it could be used for other tournaments too.

[Usage]
1. You just need to provide an input URL. The script will output some CSV files with data.
