# Introduction

This repo contains a collection of webscrapping scripts used to grab Canoe Polo data.
Sadly there currently isn't a central location where all this data is accessible. The goal is to change that.

With these webscrapping scripts I aim to make a collection of "most" match data and over time we will improve this project.
In essence this is my forever project :)
